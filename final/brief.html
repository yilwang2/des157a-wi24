        <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
        <p>I'm updating Every Picture Project, I chose this project because I like what I've done with it, but there are a few things that need to be improved and I'm hoping to make it even better.</p>

        <h2>Project Description:</h2>
        <p>I want to focus on improving the usability of the project, the first thing I want to improve is the scroll image part, I want to create some effects when the mouse hovers over the image, the purpose is to let the user clearly and quickly understand that these images are clickable. I have four ideas right now. The first idea is to have text appear when the mouse hovers over the image indicating that the user can click on the image, the second idea is to make the image "shake", the third idea is to make the image zoom in, and the fourth idea was to make the image appear as a border.  When the overlay appears, I wanted to keep only an option to turn it off, to give the user a more direct choice. I would also like to include more images for each Lego in the overlay for that Lego and use symbols such as arrows to instruct the user to browse those images.</p>

        <h2>Expert Feedback:</h2>
        <p>Since I want to focus on improving the UX/UI of my project and my target users are people of all ages and interested in Lego, I would like to share my project with a class undergrad design tutor and my friends and do usability testing.</p>
