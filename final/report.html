        <h2>Tester:</h2>
        <p>1. My friend (a graduate student) who is interested in Lego</p>
        <p>2. My friend (a UI designer) who is interested in Lego</p>

        <h2>Tester profile:</h2>
        <p>Number of users: 2</p>
        <p>Age(%): 18-29: 2 testers = 100%</p>
        <p>Gender(%): Women: 1 tester = 50%; Men: 1 tester = 50%</p>

        <h2>Tasks:</h2>
        <p>1. Focus on the images first, and write down your first impression of what the pictures are about when you see them.</p>
        <p>2. Find information about "Roses", "Orchid" and "The Starry Night".</p>
        <p>3. Find my contact information.</p>

        <h2>Result Summery:</h2>
        <p>After completing these tasks, through my observation of my tester and the interview questions they answered, I learned that when they saw these pictures, if there was a Lego they knew, they would immediately think that my theme was Lego, but they felt that from these pictures they looked more like ornaments. My testers clicked on the images because the images were the only ones on my page, not because the images shows the "information" of they can be clicked. My testers prefer to use the "x" button to close the overlays and they want to see everything at once, rather than scrolling to see hidden information. For my contact information, they would want it to be more obvious, and they wanted to see more detail about the Lego picture.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
        <p>I have 5 things want to revise.</p>
        <p>1. Make some effect to make the viewer think the picture is clickable.</p>
        <p>2. Keep only the "x" button to close overlays.</p>
        <p>3. Change the size of overlays so the audience can see all the messages at once.</p>
        <p>4. Change the font and size of the contact information.</p>
        <p>5. Add detailed images of Lego in overlays.</p>
