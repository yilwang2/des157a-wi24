        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-02-06">Feburury 06, 2024</time>

        <p>After I read this article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"> 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills,</a> I learned the importance of careful observation, whether it's an article, a picture, a cartoon, or a poem, etc., slowing down and looking closely allows us to discover more details and exercise a variety of skills. For example, patience, the ability to observe details, logic, analytical skills, language skills, and expanded knowledge.</p>

        <p>Through the methods explained in this article, as well as the examples and careful observation of the pictures in the article, I think I am beginning to master close reading and visual thinking skills. The article includes methods of close reading, as well as guiding questions to help me understand how to look at a picture. After observing some of the details, it is possible to connect them and deduce what is happening.</p>

        <p>I think this website <a href="https://onomeals.zeusjones.com/"> One</a> uses images and interaction in interesting ways to inspire Visual Thinking.</p>

        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-01-30">January 30, 2024</time>

        <p>After I read this article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,</a> I have a much clearer idea of the usefulness and function of Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows. First of all, the article describes the usage of Overlays Windows, in which cases it is appropriate to use them, and also explains in detail the elements that need to be included in Overlays Windows, and some design tips, respectively.</p>

        <p>I found this article very helpful because I realized that it mentioned points that I hadn't thought of and I can use these tips in my future designs. For example, the modal window should be on the top half of the screen to prevent losing content. I also think "Focus" is very important, when the modal window pops up, darkening the background can make the audience's eyes focus on the modal window, and also let the audience intuitively understand that they can't directly interact with the elements in the background when the modal window pops up. This article helped me a lot in designing the modal window.</p>

        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-01-24">January 24, 2024</time>

        <p>After I read this article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design,</a> I have a clearer picture of the impact and also the role of form on a website. There are many ways to improve the usability of the form included in this article that I found helpful in designing a web page.</p>

        <p>One way that stood out to me was minimizing the dropdown menus, the article mentioned that if the number of dropdown menus is less than 6, it's best to use radio buttons, and then checkboxes if there are more options, as it's important to minimize the number of clicks and the cost of interactions. This is something I hadn't considered before, I just thought that using checkboxes would make the interface look clearer, but I didn't consider whether it would be easier to use.</p>

        <p>I think <a href="https://www.jellycat.com/us/login/?target=myaccount%5Fpage">Jellycat's website form</a> is the best practice. Because the position of the label is very good, which is above the input field, we can see the label and the input field at the same time. Also, the space between the label and the input field is appropriate, and the space between the two input fields is also very appropriate.</p>
