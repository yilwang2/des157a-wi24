        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-01-24">January 24, 2024</time>

        <p>After I read this article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design,</a> I have a clearer picture of the impact and also the role of form on a website. There are many ways to improve the usability of the form included in this article that I found helpful in designing a web page.</p>

        <p>One way that stood out to me was minimizing the dropdown menus, the article mentioned that if the number of dropdown menus is less than 6, it's best to use radio buttons, and then checkboxes if there are more options, as it's important to minimize the number of clicks and the cost of interactions. This is something I hadn't considered before, I just thought that using checkboxes would make the interface look clearer, but I didn't consider whether it would be easier to use.</p>

        <p>I think <a href="https://www.jellycat.com/us/login/?target=myaccount%5Fpage">Jellycat's website form</a> is the best practice. Because the position of the label is very good, which is above the input field, we can see the label and the input field at the same time. Also, the space between the label and the input field is appropriate, and the space between the two input fields is also very appropriate.</p>
