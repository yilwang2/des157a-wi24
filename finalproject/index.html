This LEGO is easy to put together, except that many small petals require patience to mount on, but it doesn't take a lot of time.</p>

                <img src="images/bouquet4.jpg" alt="Bouquet image 4">
            </div>
            <p>The idea behind the design of this LEGO is that different types of flowers come together in beautiful bouquets by matching shapes and colors. There are 5 stems included in this LEGO set with a mix of flower and leaf varieties. It takes some time to put this LEGO set together as there are many different flowers, each one is put together differently and some have more petals. Although it takes time to put this bouquet together, the process of putting it together is very fun, and seeing one flower completed and then paired together is like pruning and arranging flowers.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This LEGO design can be used to create an elegant orchid ornament for the home or office, inspired by real orchids. The finished product of this LEGO is a larger ornament, just like a real orchid pot plant. There aren't a lot of small parts in this LEGO, but there are many parts that need to be completed, such as the pot, leaves, stem, and flower parts, which will also take some time.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The design of this LEGO is based on Van Gogh's Starry Night painting. The finished product of this LEGO is a three-dimensional painting of the starry sky, which is a beautiful three-dimensional design and is perfect for decorating your home. This LEGO takes a lot of time to put together, so you can choose to put it together with a friend. First of all, there are a lot of parts, there are also a lot of small parts, and some of the colors of the parts are also very similar, you need to carefully check the drawings to put them together. But I enjoy the process of putting together LEGO so I don't find it boring, I did it with my boyfriend and felt a sense of accomplishment when I finished.</p>
